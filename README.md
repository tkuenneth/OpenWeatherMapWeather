# OpenWeatherMapWeather
This repo contains different implementations of a small weather app based on the OpenWeatherMap service.

To access the OpenWeatherMap service, you must request an api key. Check the implementations in order to find out where to put it. The corresponding files are not uploaded to the repo intentionally. So you can use the apps only if you have provided a valid api key.
